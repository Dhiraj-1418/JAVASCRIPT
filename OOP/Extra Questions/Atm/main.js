// Scenario: You are building an ATM system where a user has a bank account. The balance should not be directly 
// accessible but can be checked via a method.

// Task:
// Create a BankAccount class with a private #balance property.
// Implement deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) methods.
// Add a getBalance() method to return the balance.

class BankAccount {

    #deposit;
    #withdrawAmount;
    #Total_Balance;

    bank_balance(deposit,withdrawAmount)
    {
        this.#deposit = deposit;
        this.#withdrawAmount = withdrawAmount;
        this.Total_Balance = deposit - withdrawAmount ;
    }

    getBalance(){

        document.writeln("Bank Balance : " + this.Total_Balance);

    }
}

const balance = new BankAccount();
balance.bank_balance(75000 , 25000);
balance.getBalance();
